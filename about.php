            <p>
                Athletic Prospects' mission is to guide each player 
                in bridging the gap between high school and collegiate athletics. 
                College coaches are looking for the commitment of the player and that's where we come into play. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Bi-weekly, we will help our athletes stand out in the recruiting process by 
                guiding them in their personal communication with coaches. Through our experience, 
                we've learned one of the greatest tools to have in the recruiting process is communication. 
                Athletic Prospects goes beyond just getting the player recognized; we get the player involved. 
                And, with our individualized process, players will be seen as a committed and motivated player that wants to play college ball. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We want serve our athletes the top notch recruitment experience that they deserve. Our focus is on the student-athlete's future. 
                That means we'll work with them to find academic scholarships, athletic scholarships, and their dream school. 
            </p>
            <p>
